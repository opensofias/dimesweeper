# dimesweeper
minesweeper in an arbitrary number of dimensions

## usage

for now it "runs in Netbeans" and one can build a jar from there. you won't need Netbeans if you know all the Java things, but i kinda don't, yet. 

if you run the Lancher, the default settings are dumb. if you don't want to play with a single field and no mines, you should change them.
